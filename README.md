### abstract

Women were moving away from the information technology field in the mid-1980s, when they were about 40% and today represent only about 15%, even today representing 55.6% of college students in Brazil. This research studies the female presence in higher education of the last decade, to understand the social factors in this context using data science analysis tools in INEP's university entry database. The presence of women in higher education is a recent achievement. Since the colonial period, women have had late access to traditional education. In the United States, Ohio, the world's first female university was founded in 1837, and in Brazil, women had access to higher education in the nineteenth century, but the most significant presence is from 1960. Today, women are the majority. in traditional education, especially with the expansion of private universities, which outnumbered public university places. In addition to the historical disadvantage and devaluation of the female workforce, in addition to the perpetuation of machismo in both academic and market environments, it understands that areas of study currently mostly male, such as technology and computing have not always been so. We understand, then, that the social context and hostility of environments perceived as masculine still dictate the choice of women, without showing an upward trend based on the past decade. For analysis on women's entry into higher education, Bezerra (2010) is used as a reference.
